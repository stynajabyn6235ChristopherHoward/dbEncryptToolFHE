# dbEncryptToolFHE: Transforming Databases with FHE-Powered Privacy

dbEncryptToolFHE is a sophisticated software tool designed to convert traditional relational databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases into FHE-encrypted versions that support homomorphic queries. At the core of this transformative capability lies **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. By leveraging this cutting-edge encryption, businesses can enhance their data privacy without overhauling their existing architecture.

## Addressing the Challenge

In an age where data breaches and privacy concerns are rampant, traditional database systems often leave sensitive information exposed. Companies struggle to maintain data security while ensuring usability and operational efficiency. The pressure to comply with stringent regulations and protect customer information has never been more significant. As a result, enterprises face the daunting task of protecting their data without sacrificing performance or scalability.

## How FHE Bridges the Gap

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) offers a groundbreaking solution to the privacy challenges faced by businesses. With FHE, it is possible to perform computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This means that sensitive data can remain private even while being processed. Our dbEncryptToolFHE utilizes **Zama's open-source libraries** such as **Concrete**, **TFHE-rs**, and the **zama-fhe SDK** to streamline the transition from conventional databases to secure, encrypted databases that allow for advanced querying capabilities while keeping data confidential.

## Core Features

- **Automated Database Encryption & Migration**: Seamlessly transition your existing databases to FHE-encrypted ones with minimal interruption.
- **Support for Homomorphic Queries**: Execute queries on encrypted data, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected throughout the process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to help traditional enterprises embrace data privacy without drastic changes to their existing setups.
- **Scalable Design**: Suitable for a wide range of database types, including both relational and NoSQL databases.
- **Detailed Migration Guide**: Step-by-step instructions that guide users through the encryption and migration process.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**: Primary component for implementing confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for Ethereum-based applications.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL/NoSQL**: Supported database systems for conversion.

## Installation Guide

To set up the dbEncryptToolFHE project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. Install **Hardhat** globally, if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install --global hardhat
   ```

3. After downloading this project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

⚠️ **Important**: Do not use `git clone` or any URLs.

## Build & Run Instructions

Once the installation is complete, you can compile, test, and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests** to ensure everything is working correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Execute the main script** to initiate the encryption process:
   ```bash
   node src/encrypt.js
   ```

### Example Usage

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to encrypt a database connection and migrate it to an FHE-enabled version:

```javascript
const { encryptDatabase, migrateDatabase } = require('./src/encrypt');

// Replace with actual database credentials
const dbConfig = {
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'user',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'mydatabase'
};

// Encrypt the database
async function startEncryption() {
  try {
    const encryptedDb = await encryptDatabase(dbConfig);
    console.log("Database encrypted successfully:", encryptedDb);

    // Migrate to FHE-enabled database
    const migrationResult = await migrateDatabase(encryptedDb);
    console.log("Migration completed successfully:", migrationResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during encryption or migration:", error);
  }
}

startEncryption();
```
